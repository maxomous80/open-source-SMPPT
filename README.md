Open Source Hardware Smart Maximum Power Point Tracker

This repo hosts the instructions, design and hardware files for the implementation of an open source FPGA-based smart converter system developed for photovoltaic and renewable energies systems, up to 450 W. 
The platform has been conceived and released as an open hardware instrument for the academic and industrial sector, to benefit from the researchers' community improvements.
The usage of an FPGA-based open platform would allow more developers to design smart converters, focusing on algorithms instead of electronics, which could result in a better overall development ecosystem and rapid growth in the number of smart converter applications. 
The designed system is capable of implementing Maximum Power Point Tracking accurately, allowing the test of different current and voltage-controlled algorithms for different renewable energies systems. 
The system features a bi-directional Radio Frequency communication channel that enables real-time reading of measurements and parameters, and remote modification of both algorithms type and settings.
