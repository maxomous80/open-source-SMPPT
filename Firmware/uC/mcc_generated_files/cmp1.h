  @Summary
    This is the generated header file for the CMP1 driver using PIC24 / dsPIC33 / PIC32MM MCUs

  @Description
    This header file provides APIs for driver for CMP1.
    Generation Information :
        Product Revision  :  PIC24 / dsPIC33 / PIC32MM MCUs - pic24-dspic-pic32mm : 1.55
        Device            :  dsPIC33EP64GS504
    The generated drivers are tested against the following:
        Compiler          :  XC16 v1.34
        MPLAB 	          :  MPLAB X v4.15
